 BoxGallary collects results from my spare time renderer. It features Physically Base Rendering.

The dragon features transmission and volume where different thickness leads to different attenuation (colour appears yellowish at foot).

Iridescence is the effect of light interference due to thin film layers. Below features Suzanne with iridescence (rainbow colour), transmission and volume (refraction). The left Suzanne has a high metallic value, 400nm thin-film layer thickness value.
